fseconomy-client-fs9
====================

FSEconomy .NET UI client for fs9

this is the base fs9 client used by the FSEconomy web site to send data to/from the simulator.

this version requires the free (or paid will work also) version of FSUIPC.

this client will work with fs9/x and p3d so long as you have the FSUIPC installed and running inside your simulator.
